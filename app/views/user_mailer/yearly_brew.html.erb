                  Let's look at what you've been brewing this year.
                  I've tallied up all your shots and sips - well, the ones you've shared with me anyway. ðŸ˜…

                  I've recently introduced AI-powered coffee bag information extraction! If you're using Coffee Management,
                  you can now paste a URL of a coffee you want to add, and Visualizer will automatically fetch all the relevant information.
                  Check out the <a class="hover-no-underline" target="_blank" style="color: #db3e27; text-decoration-line: underline" href="https://visualizer.coffee/updates/ai-comes-to-visualizer">full announcement</a> to see it in action. ðŸ¤–

                <p style="margin: 0 0 24px; font-size: 16px; color: #000">
                  I've also made two important decisions about Visualizer's future: no more discounts ever, and no price increases for the foreseeable future.
                  The way I <em>celebrated</em> Black Friday is by giving every existing subscriber an extra free month and everyone who signs up until the end of the year gets a 37-day free trial instead of the usual 7.
                  Read more about this and other updates in the <a class="hover-no-underline" target="_blank" style="color: #db3e27; text-decoration-line: underline" href="https://visualizer.coffee/updates/black-friday">Black Friday post</a>. ðŸ’ª

                  Another year of shots, discoveries, and coffee moments comes to an end. Thank you for being part of this journey - your uploads, feedback, and enthusiasm make Visualizer what it is. It's amazing to see how this little project has grown into such a vibrant community of coffee lovers.

                  Speaking of coffee - my friend <a href="https://banibeans.si/" class="hover-no-underline" target="_blank" style="color: #db3e27; text-decoration-line: underline">Banibeans</a> is still offering Visualizer users a special 10% discount with code <code style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #e5e5e5; padding-left: 4px; padding-right: 4px; color: #262626">VISUALIZER10</code>.
                  Perfect timing if you're looking to start 2025 with some amazing beans or if you're looking for a last second gift for a fellow coffee enthusiast! âœ¨
