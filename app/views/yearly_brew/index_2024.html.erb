          This is your personal coffee chronicle of the year.
          A data-driven journey through every bean you've ground, every shot you've pulled, and every sip you've savored.
          Well, at least the ones I could find in my database. 😅
        <% else %>
          You haven't uploaded any shots this year. 😔
          Hopefully, you'll have some to look back on next year! I can't wait to see your coffee journey unfold.
