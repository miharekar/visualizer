# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
- Using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/miharekar/decent-visualizer/issues)
- Changing the code


## Using GitHub Issues

Use GitHub Issues to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use GitHub Issues to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code_
guidance below.


## Changing the code

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have associated
unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code.
